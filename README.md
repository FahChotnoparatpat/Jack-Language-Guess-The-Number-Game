**Overview**

This project implements an interactive "Guess the Number" game using the Jack programming language. The game involves the player choosing a number between 1 and 100, and the program attempts to guess that number through a series of iterations based on the player's responses. The game provides a visual representation of the guessing process through a graphical interface.

**Installation and Deployment**

To run the game, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install a Jack Compiler** 

2. **Compile the Code**: Compile all the .jack files in the project using your Jack compiler. This will generate corresponding .vm files.

3.  **Deploy the VM Files**: Deploy the generated .vm files on a virtual machine or an emulator compatible with the Jack virtual machine architecture.

4. **Run the Virtual Machine**: Start the virtual machine or emulator, and load the deployed .vm files onto it.

5. S**tart the Game**: Once the virtual machine is running, execute the Main.vm file to start the game.

6. **Follow On-Screen Instructions**: The game will prompt you to think of a number between 1 and 100, and then guide you through the guessing process. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide feedback on each guess until the game correctly guesses your number.

7. **Play Again** (Optional): After completing a game, you will have the option to play again. Follow the prompts to either start a new game or exit the program.

**Project Structure**

**Bar.jack:** Defines the Bar class responsible for visualizing the guessing bar.

**Game.jack:** Implements the Game class that manages the game logic and controls the interaction between the player and the guessing algorithm.

**Main.jack:** Contains the Main class, which serves as the entry point for the game and orchestrates the initialization and execution of the game.

**Player.jack:** Defines the Player class, which handles interactions with the player, such as prompting them to choose a number.


**Enjoy playing "Guess the Number"!**
